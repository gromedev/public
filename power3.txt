I am using Power BI  
I have a table called computers  
it contains these columns:  
computers.Properties.name —> computer name  
computers.LocalGroups.Results.ObjectIdentifier —> User SIDs  
computers.LocalGroups.Names —> local group names  

I have another table called ADUsers  
it contains these columns:  
UserIdentifier —> User Names  
ObjectSid —> User SIDs  

Both tables have SIDs that correspond to users
The ADUsers table has user names that correspond to SIDs

<complication>
Each table has unique values and/or null values that the other table is missing. 
Any DAX code must take into account unique and/or null values in order to establish the relationship
</complication>

<objective>
I want to make a relationship between these two tables so that I can see what User Names are in which Local Groups on what computers  

I then want to make a visualization that will show which groups, on which computers, have which users
</objective>
