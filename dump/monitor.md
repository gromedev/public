You're absolutely right. For the PoC to work correctly, the second script should continue running and capture all traffic until you decide to stop it manually. Iâ€™ll remove all functions that stop the `tcpdump` process and disable monitor mode, allowing it to run continuously. Here are the updated scripts:

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Bash Script for Capturing the WPA2 Handshake (`capture_handshake.sh`)**

This script captures the WPA2 handshake from your Kali machine.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the wireless interface and put it into monitor mode
INTERFACE="wlan0"  # Adjust if necessary
airmon-ng start $INTERFACE

# Set the monitor mode interface name
MONITOR_INTERFACE="${INTERFACE}mon"

# Specify target network details (replace with actual details found via airodump-ng)
TARGET_BSSID="AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"  # Replace with your network's BSSID
CHANNEL="6"  # Replace with your network's channel

# Start capturing traffic to capture the WPA2 handshake
airodump-ng --bssid $TARGET_BSSID -c $CHANNEL -w capture $MONITOR_INTERFACE &

# Sleep for an extended period to ensure capturing of the handshake
sleep 180  # Capture for 3 minutes to ensure handshake capture

echo "Handshake capture completed. Check the capture-01.cap file."
```

#### **Run this script first** and ensure that your Windows machine disconnects and reconnects to capture the handshake.

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Modified Bash Script for Capturing Wi-Fi Traffic (`capture_wifi_traffic.sh`)**

This version captures all traffic without stopping the `tcpdump` process or monitor mode. You'll manually stop the process when you're done.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the wireless interface and put it into monitor mode
INTERFACE="wlan0"  # Adjust if necessary
airmon-ng start $INTERFACE

# Set the monitor mode interface name
MONITOR_INTERFACE="${INTERFACE}mon"

# Start capturing traffic using tcpdump for DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP traffic
tcpdump -i $MONITOR_INTERFACE port 53 or port 80 or port 443 or port 21 -w captured_traffic.pcap

# The script will continue running until you stop it manually (Ctrl+C)
```

#### **Run this script second** and let it continue capturing traffic until youâ€™re ready to stop it manually using `Ctrl+C`.

### ðŸ”¹ **3. PowerShell Script for Simulating Traffic (`SimulateWiFiTraffic.ps1`)**

This script generates network traffic from your Windows machine.

```powershell
# PowerShell script to simulate unencrypted and encrypted traffic

# Function to simulate HTTP POST request
function Send-HttpRequest {
    $url = "http://example.com/login"
    $username = "testuser"
    $password = "password123"
    $body = "username=$username&password=$password"
    
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method POST -Body $body
}

# Function to simulate HTTPS request
function Send-HttpsRequest {
    $url = "https://example.com/login"
    $username = "secureuser"
    $password = "securepassword123"
    $body = "username=$username&password=$password"

    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method POST -Body $body
}

# Function to simulate FTP traffic
function Send-FTPRequest {
    $ftpServer = "ftp.example.com"
    $ftpUser = "ftpuser"
    $ftpPass = "ftppassword123"
    $filePath = "C:\\Users\\Public\\testfile.txt"
    
    # Create a simple text file to upload
    Set-Content -Path $filePath -Value "This is a test file."
    $webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    $webclient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential($ftpUser, $ftpPass)
    $webclient.UploadFile("ftp://$ftpServer/testfile.txt", $filePath)
}

# Function to simulate DNS requests
function Send-DNSQueries {
    $domains = @("example.com", "testsite.com", "mytestdomain.com")
    foreach ($domain in $domains) {
        nslookup $domain | Out-Null
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
    }
}

# Execute all traffic simulations
Send-HttpRequest
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
Send-HttpsRequest
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
Send-FTPRequest
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
Send-DNSQueries
```

#### **Run this script on your Windows machine after reconnecting to the network** to simulate traffic that your Kali machine will capture.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Bash Script for Analyzing Traffic (`analyze_traffic.sh`)**

This script opens the captured `.pcap` file with Wireshark for analysis. This script doesn't crack the handshake but helps you analyze the captured data effectively.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Open the captured traffic file in Wireshark for analysis
wireshark captured_traffic.pcap
```

#### **Run this script last** once youâ€™ve captured sufficient traffic and are ready to analyze the data.

### ðŸ”¹ **Summary of the Correct Process**

1. **Run `capture_handshake.sh`**: Capture the WPA2 handshake. Manually reconnect your Windows machine to the Wi-Fi during this period.
2. **Run `capture_wifi_traffic.sh`**: Start capturing all network traffic. Let it run continuously until youâ€™re finished.
3. **Run `SimulateWiFiTraffic.ps1`** on your Windows machine to generate traffic.
4. **Run `analyze_traffic.sh`** to analyze the captured traffic using Wireshark.

By removing the stopping processes in the second script, you now have a continuous capture until you manually end it, ensuring that all simulated traffic will be captured for your PoC.
