To address your query about the most recent and latest User Account Control (UAC) bypass methods for Windows 10 and 11, I’ve compiled a detailed overview of the techniques that have been actively used or recently discovered. These methods exploit various Windows features and vulnerabilities to elevate privileges without triggering the UAC prompt. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of these bypass techniques, including descriptions, technical details, and mitigation strategies.

1. Exploitation of COM Interfaces with Auto-Elevate Property

	•	Description: Attackers exploit Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that are configured to auto-elevate, meaning they can run with elevated privileges without prompting UAC. These COM objects are often used to perform privileged actions silently.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	COM objects with the “Elevation – Enable – 1” property are registered in the Windows Registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID.
	•	Attackers identify these objects and use scripts (e.g., PowerShell) or custom code to invoke them, executing commands as an elevated user.
	•	Example: A COM object tied to a system process might allow execution of arbitrary code in an elevated context.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Apply Windows updates to patch vulnerabilities in COM objects.
	•	Monitor registry changes in HKLM and HKCU for unauthorized modifications to COM-related keys.
	•	Use endpoint detection tools to flag invocations of unusual COM objects.

2. Registry Manipulation (e.g., ms-settings Hijack)

	•	Description: This technique manipulates registry keys to hijack the execution flow of trusted, auto-elevated programs like fodhelper.exe, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Attackers modify HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command to redirect execution.
	•	When fodhelper.exe (a legitimate Windows binary) is launched, it reads the altered registry key and executes the attacker-specified command instead of its intended function.
	•	This bypasses UAC because fodhelper.exe is inherently trusted and auto-elevated.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Monitor registry changes in the HKCU\Software\Classes hive using security tools.
	•	Restrict write access to sensitive registry paths for standard users.
	•	Audit execution of auto-elevated binaries for unexpected behavior.

3. Exploitation of Trusted Path Collisions

	•	Description: By manipulating file paths, attackers trick Windows into accepting malicious binaries as trusted, bypassing UAC’s path validation for auto-elevated processes.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Windows NT path normalization (used by UAC) can be exploited by adding extra spaces, dots, or special characters to file paths (e.g., C:\Windows\ System32\calc.exe vs. C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe).
	•	This confuses the UAC service into treating a malicious executable as a trusted, auto-elevated binary.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Ensure all auto-elevated binaries are digitally signed by Microsoft.
	•	Use process monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals Process Explorer) to detect unusual path manipulations.
	•	Implement file system integrity checks.

4. DLL Hijacking in Auto-Elevated Processes

	•	Description: Attackers exploit the DLL search order in auto-elevated processes to load malicious DLLs from writable locations, gaining elevated privileges.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Auto-elevated binaries (e.g., computerdefaults.exe) search for DLLs in specific directories.
	•	By placing a malicious DLL in a writable directory (e.g., C:\Users\Public), attackers can hijack the process and execute code in an elevated context.
	•	Often paired with mock folder techniques to bypass directory restrictions.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Use Process Monitor to detect unauthorized DLL loading.
	•	Harden system directories to prevent write access by standard users.
	•	Verify the integrity of DLLs loaded by trusted processes.

5. Exploitation of Windows Features via SilentCleanup

	•	Description: The SilentCleanup scheduled task, designed for system maintenance, can be exploited via DLL sideloading to execute code with elevated privileges.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	SilentCleanup runs cleanmgr.exe and dismhost.exe with SYSTEM privileges.
	•	Attackers place a malicious DLL in a directory searched by dismhost.exe (e.g., a missing dependency path), which is then loaded during task execution.
	•	This method works on both Windows 10 and 11, even with UAC set to “Always Notify.”
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Monitor scheduled tasks for modifications or unexpected executions.
	•	Audit DLL loading behavior in system processes.
	•	Restrict access to directories used by maintenance tasks.

6. Mock Trusted Folder Technique

	•	Description: Attackers create mock folder structures mimicking trusted directories (e.g., C:\Windows \System32) to trick auto-elevated executables into loading malicious DLLs.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	By creating a directory like C:\Windows \System32 (note the space), attackers exploit Windows’ path resolution quirks.
	•	Auto-elevated processes may load DLLs from this fake directory instead of the legitimate C:\Windows\System32.
	•	This allows execution of malicious code with elevated privileges.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Deploy file system monitoring to detect the creation of suspicious directories.
	•	Use application control policies to whitelist trusted binaries and their dependencies.
	•	Regularly audit folder permissions.

7. Exploitation of Windows 11-Specific Features

	•	Description: New features and updated binaries in Windows 11 introduce potential UAC bypass opportunities, often involving newly added COM objects or auto-elevated processes.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Windows 11 includes updated system components that may have unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
	•	Attackers analyze these components (e.g., new Settings app processes) to identify auto-elevation points and hijack their execution.
	•	Specific exploits are still emerging as researchers investigate Windows 11’s changes.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Apply the latest Windows 11 patches promptly.
	•	Monitor for unusual process behavior tied to new system features.
	•	Stay informed about emerging security research on Windows 11.

8. CVE-2024-6769: Windows UAC Bypass via Privilege Escalation

	•	Description: This recently identified vulnerability allows attackers to bypass UAC and escalate from medium to full system privileges without a prompt.
	•	Technical Details:
	•	Exploits a flaw in how Windows manages security boundaries and integrity levels.
	•	Attackers combine multiple techniques (e.g., registry manipulation and process injection) to take ownership of system files or directories.
	•	Effective on both Windows 10 and 11, making it a significant threat.
	•	Mitigation:
	•	Install the latest Windows security updates to patch this CVE.
	•	Monitor for privilege escalation attempts using security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
	•	Enforce least-privilege policies to limit exposure.

Conclusion

UAC bypass methods for Windows 10 and 11 are constantly evolving as attackers uncover new ways to exploit system features and vulnerabilities. The techniques described above—ranging from COM exploitation to DLL hijacking and Windows 11-specific attacks—represent the latest and most effective methods as of recent research and disclosures. To defend against these threats, keep your system fully updated, set UAC to its highest level (“Always Notify”), and use monit ve
