.DESCRIPTION

  A collection of templates (mainly VBA Macros) developed to trigger Attack Surface Reduction rules in Azure tenants.  
  Payloads launch calc.exe (mostly) - but otherwise fill in whatever code/template you want. 
  THIS IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY! These files are guaranteed to trigger ASR anyways. 
  Probably also Defender in Windows home editions. No idea. Haven't tested. 

  
  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
