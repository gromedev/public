.DESCRIPTION

  A collection of templates (mainly VBA Macros) developed to trigger Attack Surface Reduction rules in Azure tenants. 
  
  Payloads consist of launching calc.exe - but otherwise fill in whatever code/template you want. 
  
  THIS IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY! These files are guaranteed to trigger ASR anyways. 
  
  Probably also Defender in Windows home editions. No idea. Haven't tested.
